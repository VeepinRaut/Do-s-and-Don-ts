Some Suggestions for the person who is writing journal 1st time
The Do’s
1.	Before starting to write a scientific article, we should have gone through several articles either related to the topic we are going to include or not.
2.	For writing a journal paper or any article, its always a good practice to make an outline of it.
3.	Need to keep in mind that, you are the person who knows the background idea of the article. So, you have to spotlight the main ideas and methodologies clearly.
4.	As, the paper is written after an idea/methodology has been implemented and results are obtained, So the presentation of the method is very important to make it understandable to the readers.
5.	Try to refer diverse sources with up-to-date information related to the topic.
6.	You should provide sufficient justification of your research work.
7.	For any particular section in your journal, there should have cause and effect.
8.	Honesty is always the best thing – try to be honest in writing your findings. 
9.	It is a good way to me to start writing individual section of the paper to solely focus on it. After that all the sections should be connected in a way so that it maintains proper flow to understand the topic.
10.	Include more scientific terminologies related to your topic. It will give comfort to the readers to correlate with other journals in your specific area.
11.	Keep track of the multiple times of changes in your writing in Microsoft word document.
12.	Try to use any referencing software like Endnote to cite references easily maintaining the format of the specific journal.
13.	Proof reading is vital for all specially for a person (like me ☹) whose native language is not English. Fine tuning of the paper by taking help from any professional is mandatory to write a good one.
14.	Before submission to the journal, ask as much question as you can in your writing. It will help you to scrutinize the problems in your writing beforehand.
The Don’ts
1.	Do not misinterpret the findings from your analysis.
2.	Do not write any method superficially which is not common to the scientific community in your area.
3.	Do not cite Wikipedia, its best to cite research articles.
4.	Do not repeat any information what is already given in any section.
5.	Do not copy any line from anywhere, its always better to write any statement in your own way (but need to provide the supporting references as well).
6.	Do not lengthen your paper unnecessarily, it creates boredom to the reader.
7.	Never include anything that is confusing and will not answer the questions that might arise in the review process.
8.	Never write anything from hypothesis/imagination; You should provide ample resources/references as justifications.
9.	Do not generalize your ideas/findings; Try to be more specific in the topic you are interested in.
10.	Do not provide anything in your paper that is irrelevant to your work.

Do:
•	Make up your mind about the layout of your work (stories)
•	Write a very detail outline of the paper
•	Discuss the past and present scenario and how your work is novel
•	Provide sufficient supporting arguments to reinforce your findings
•	Have someone else to read the paper before you turn it in
•	Use active voice
•	Use consistent tense
•	Read all the relevant papers 

Don’t:
•	Don’t use first person pronouns (“I”,” We”, “me”)
•	Don’t misinterpret yourself
•	Don’t lengthen your paper unnecessarily
•	Don’t add new information in conclusion


Oral Exam
Do
•	Start as early as possible to prepare (3 weeks or 1 month depending on your graphs on course work)
•	Make a schedule for all the subjects you are going to prepare
•	Prepare in two rounds
o	First: build the overall ideas of each subjects
o	Second: prepare in depth than first round
•	Listen the questions very carefully before you answer because most of the time students misinterpret the question. It not wrong to ask to repeat the questions
•	Try to be figurative while answering the questions, it helps a lot to describe and make the committee members understand
•	Don’t give an answer to the questions that you are not asked for
•	Speak loud and clear 

Don’t
•	Don’t start to prepare randomly, it only kills your time
•	Don’t spend too much time in few subjects because you won’t get time for other ones
•	Don’t assume the question you are asked, just be clear about the question you are going to answer
•	Don’t panic or get nervous if you can’t answer the question or don’t know the answer, it okay to say “I don’t know”. Most of the time student tries to answer the question which they don’t know and put themselves into more problems
•	Don’t assume that committee members are there to fail you, they are there to access you and help you
